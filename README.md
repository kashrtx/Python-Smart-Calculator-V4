Description: Hello, and Welcome to Smart Python Calculator V4! The calculator is
now an interactive GUI instead of a CMD terminal, where you can can input from 
the GUI  buttons, keyboard input (click the box where the numbers output), and 
from voice recognition (using the MIC button). 
________________________________________________________________________________

Info:
- You can use addition (+), multiplication (*), division (/), integer division (//), exponents (**), and square root [sqrt(#) or (#)**(0.5)]. Paranteses are also supported to format your expression (, ).

- Calculator automatically uses BEDMAS.

- You can manually change the expression you spoke via voice recogntion (MIC), by clicking at the input region of the calculator, and then using keyboard or button to change the format, number or operators.

- Square root command can be off in the format sometimes, for example if you say "Square root one-hundred  plus one" it will be recognized as sqrt(100 + 1) 
  or (100 + 1)**(0.5). Edit the input to ensure it is right for you.
